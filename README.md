# AniOne
Currently using 1.9B params

All the external data will be hosted on AniTwo, this external data includes, but isn't limited to:
project files
original datasets (hosted as ipfs or torrent)
backups of older versions (v1-v4 for now)
guides
presets for 2-24gb vram machines (2/3GB are discouraged)
tests with non CUDA compliant machines (aka AMD or maybe even intel ARC)
options to contribute


AniOne v4:
Latest public can be found here:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Be1Km0qhyAeuH6nmsLcxfA0ObhNmH27A?usp=sharing 

ipfs:
comming soon

AniOne v5:
not for public release

AniOne v6:
still undergoing testing

AniOne v7:
focus on optimization so everyone can run it (with at least a 1050 or newer)
will include non optimized gpus like tesla and quadro's
this will also include a docker container to run it more smoothly, and most of the project will be moved from python to Rust.
rust allows me to later run it on way more powerfull power9 hardware in a docker KVM or similar.

AniOne v8 will be the next public release, and is expected in a month or so,
then all releases will merge to the new release scheme: 

If you want to contribute, feel free to buy me a coffee (:
