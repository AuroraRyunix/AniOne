# AniOne
Currently using 1.9B params

All the external data will be hosted on AniTwo, this external data includes, but isn't limited to:
project files
original datasets (hosted as ipfs or torrent)
backups of older versions (v1-v4 for now)
guides
presets for 2-24gb vram machines (2/3GB are discouraged)
tests with non CUDA compliant machines (aka AMD or maybe even intel ARC)
All testing is done on:
DL560 G10
quad tesla M40 24GB

AniOne v4:
archived - (pull request)

ipfs:
comming soon

AniOne v5:
not for public release

AniOne v6:
still undergoing testing

AniOne v7:
focus on optimization so everyone can run it (with at least a 1050 or newer)
will include non optimized gpus like tesla and quadro's
this will also include a docker container to run it more smoothly, and most of the project will be moved from python to Rust.
rust allows me to later run it on way more powerfull power9 hardware in a docker KVM or similar.
available on the drive link

AniOne v8:
Released (faster then expceted)

AniOne v9:
currently undergoing testing, v7 public release
